## 🚧 Future Features

We're planning to expand HostelAdda with these features to make hostel life even easier:

- 💬 Chat section — real-time or threaded messaging inside each post (or global chat rooms) so participants can coordinate details like order splits, item choices, and delivery timing.
- 🏘️ Room section — a lightweight directory to list rooms/blocks and allow room-level notices or group orders tied to a room.
- 👤 Profile section — richer user profiles with avatars, contact preferences, past participation history and rating/badges.
- 🚗 Cab sharing facilities — allow users to create/join ride shares to nearby markets or delivery pickup locations with time/location details.
- 📝 Complaints section — users can file complaints or maintenance requests; admins can track and respond to issues.
- 💳 Payment gateway integration — split payments, collect contributions for group orders, or integrate with popular gateways (Stripe/PayPal) for secure payment.
